# DDoS-Attack-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to network security by overwhelming systems with excessive traffic, leading to disruptions or outages. This project aims to improve DDoS protection using machine learning techniques for efficient detection and response to these attacks.
Datasets Imbalanced Dataset: Contains a majority of normal traffic with a small proportion of DDoS attacks, making it challenging to accurately detect the minority class. Balanced Dataset: Features an equal distribution of normal and attack traffic, allowing for a more balanced evaluation of model performance.

Machine Learning Techniques Supervised Learning: Uses algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for traffic classification. Ensemble Methods: Combines multiple models to enhance accuracy and reduce overfitting. Anomaly Detection: Identifies deviations from typical traffic patterns to detect potential attacks.

Objectives Detection Accuracy: Achieve high model accuracy of 99.99777%, accurately classifying traffic as benign or malicious. Handling Imbalance: Apply strategies like resampling and synthetic data generation to address class imbalance. Real-Time Response: Develop models capable of detecting and responding to attacks in real-time. Results and Insights The project’s model achieved a remarkable accuracy of 99.99777%. The time taken to fit and predict using the model was 69.872 minutes, demonstrating both high performance and efficiency. Analyzing results from both imbalanced and balanced datasets has helped refine detection approaches and improve overall DDoS protection.

Conclusion Applying machine learning to DDoS attack detection offers a robust solution for enhancing network security. The project’s methodologies, coupled with the high accuracy and efficient processing time, contribute to more effective defenses against sophisticated cyber threats.
