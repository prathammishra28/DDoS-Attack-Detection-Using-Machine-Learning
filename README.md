# DDoS-Attack-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks pose a significant threat to network security by overwhelming systems with excessive traffic, leading to disruptions or outages. This project aims to improve DDoS protection using machine learning techniques for efficient detection and response to these attacks.
